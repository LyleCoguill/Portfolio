Introduction:

Embarking on the entrepreneurial journey is a terrifying experience, filled with challenges and triumphs. For those daring enough to navigate the complexities of the business world, the story of Coguill Development and Coguill Ventures is a testament to the diverse and dynamic nature of entrepreneurship. In this article, I delve into the founder's experience of establishing two businesses – one in the realm of software development and the other in executive protection risk management.

Coguill Development - Nurturing Innovation in Code:

Coguill Development was born out of a passion for technology and a desire to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. The growing world of web3, crypto, and AI integration was fascinating and I had to understand more and be a part of this movement. As I delved into the software development landscape, the vision for Coguill Development emerged – to be a hub where anyone can bring their idea to life from a personal blog to help raise funding to a custom LLM (Large Language Model) to assist in patient understanding and doctor diagnosis of medical data and reports.

In the initial stages, I faced the typical challenges of a startup – where should I bank, what kind of company should I be, what is an s-corp vs just an LLC. However, I found an infinite number of resources through friendly conversation and simple research. Coguill Development started to gain traction and specialized in custom software solutions, embracing the latest technologies to deliver scalable and efficient products.

The journey of Coguill Development was marked by constant adaptation to industry trends, along with what I enjoyed and wanted my business to look like and represent. You have to have fun with what you are doing. Take pride in your work and enjoy the ride.

Coguill Ventures - Safeguarding Executives in a Complex World:

The inception of Coguill Ventures, a venture dedicated to executive protection and risk management.

My law enforcement background, particularly my SWAT experience instilled in me a passion for protecting those around me. The first rule for this protection is communication. You don’t do this alone. This birthed the need for a team environment.

Working in a team is the most rewarding experience. Having the common goal, striving for perfection, continuous reps of getting beat up, battered, and bruised, and still being able to come out on the other side with a win AND your buddies at your side. There is no other feeling like it in the world.

Whether you are working high risk operations or in an office cubical. Do NOT venture out and tackle your problems alone. There is more joy and satisfaction in life when you get to celebrate it with someone else and they get to share that experience also.

Conclusion:

The journey of founding and managing two businesses, Coguill Development and Coguill Ventures, is a testament to:

“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” -Mark Twain.

From coding innovative solutions to safeguarding high-profile individuals, my story is not one I did on my own. I could only have resilience, adaptability, and visionary thinking because I trusted those around me to help shape what I wanted to grow. I hope my story inspires you to view what you love as a way to always be doing what you love.
